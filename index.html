    <h1>When buying and flipping new items, it’s good to know that many stores, such as Walmart,
        Target, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, etc., have apps in which items can be scanned on the phone 
        and the cost for each will be shown. Also, another great website to use when buying and 
        flipping is Brickseat.com. This site shows discounted prices at store locations nearest 
        to you. What most people do not realize is that many items are listed as one price in the 
        store and as a lesser price on the app. For example, a product might retail as $39.98 in 
        the Walmart store, but once scanned it may come up as $4.00. At this point, you go to your 
        Amazon app, scan the product to see how much its selling for (let’s just say $35.99), buy 
        the product, resell it through Amazon, and make a $31.99 profit per item. A tip I would 
        give is to buy as many of the item that the store has in its stock and resell all of them 
        on Amazon.</h1>
