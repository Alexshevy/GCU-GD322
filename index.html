        <h1>Buy and Flip (new items)</h1>
        <p>When buying and flipping new items, it’s good to know that many stores, such as Walmart,
      Target, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, etc., have apps in which items can be scanned on the phone 
      and the cost for each will be shown. Also, another great website to use when buying and 
      flipping is Brickseat.com. This site shows discounted prices at store locations nearest 
      to you. What most people do not realize is that many items are listed as one price in the 
      store and as a lesser price on the app. For example, a product might retail as $39.98 in 
      the Walmart store, but once scanned it may come up as $4.00. At this point, you go to your 
      Amazon app, scan the product to see how much its selling for (let’s just say $35.99), buy 
      the product, resell it through Amazon, and make a $31.99 profit per item. A tip I would 
      give is to buy as many of the item that the store has in its stock and resell all of them 
      on Amazon.</p>
     
      <h1>In-Store Scanning:</h1>
      
      <p>Step 1: Download the store’s app (Example: If you’re at Walmart, then download the Walmart app) </p>
      <p>Step 2: Go to the clearance aisle and scan items to see the current discounts</p>
      <p>Step 3: If you find a good item that has a good discount, then search for it on Amazon 
          to see their selling price.</p>
      <p>Step 4: If the profit is worth it, then purchase as many of the item as there are and check out.</p>    
      <p>Step 5: Set up an Amazon seller account and sell through Amazon.</p>

      <h1>Online Scanning:</h1>

      <p>Step 1: Go to Brickseat.com and put in your zip code. Once that is completed, a list of local stores 
          with clearance items will be given.</p>
      <p>Step 2: Go to the store. Search for the item on Amazon to see the selling price.</p>   
      <p>Step 3: Decide if the profit is worth it. If so, make the purchase. </p> 
      <p>Step 4: Set up an Amazon seller account and sell through Amazon.</p>

  <H1>Pick and Flip </H1>
<p>When springtime comes around everyone seems to be doing spring cleaning. 
Many townships have bulk/garbage pick-up days, in which everyone puts their used furniture, 
toys, tools, and anything imaginable on the curb. This is when you drive through the 
neighborhoods and pick up anything that is valuable to resell. Remember to keep in mind that 
since you are making a 100% profit it could be sold for less than its actual value. For example, 
let say there is a wooden rocking chair in good condition, and a similar new one would cost $100. 
I could then sell the used wooden rocking chair for $75 on the Facebook Marketplace and make a 100% 
profit. In addition, items picked up from the curb could be refurbished (painted and cleaned) to 
increase its value.</p>


<H1>How To Pick and Flip </H1>

<p>Step 1: Look up the bulk/garbage pick-up dates and times for the towns in your local county or 
surrounding counties. Keep in mind this is usually seasonal and lasts from spring to early summer.</p>

<p>Step 2: Once the dates and times are known, print out a map of the town, and highlight the 
neighborhood you want to check out.</p>

<p>Step 3: Begin to drive around and pick up any items which seem to be in resalable condition</p>

<p>Step 4: Clean up items and take good pictures.</p>

<p>Step 5: Post them on the Facebook Marketplace and wait for responses</p>

        <h1>Is this ethical?</h1>

        <p>This can be debated; however, if I pick up something from the 
            side of the road and resell it for $150 when brand new ones are being
            sold for $300-$400, then this is actually giving someone the opportunity 
            to buy something he or she needs for less money. Many stores have non-negotiable
            prices, whereas, with these resales the price can be negotiated.</p>

        <h1>Does this help the environment/is it better for the environment?</h1>

        <p>Yes, both ways of flipping are better for our environment. First, buying and 
            flipping is better because if no one buys the product, then it will be wasted. Meanwhile, 
            there’s usually a demand for it in other stores. With the pick and flip, people throw 
            items in the garbage and by taking the items and reselling them, it is less garbage being 
            put into the landfills. As the saying goes, “One man’s junk is another man's treasure.”</p>

        <h1>What’s the average amount of money you can make?</h1>

        <p>There’s no set amount because it fluctuates depending on what deals you find and how much 
            the items sell for.</p>

        <h1>Is this consider capitalism?</h1>

        <p>Yes, this is considered capitalism; however, aren’t we lucky to live in a country where we 
            have the freedom to work hard and make money? If everything was free, we wouldn’t be a successful 
            country.</p>

        <h1>The best part about reselling?</h1>

        <p>The best part about reselling is meeting and helping members of the community. From my experience,
            I have met many amazing people who I still communicate with after the sale.</p>

        <h1>How do you find good deals or bulk pick up dates?</h1>

        <p>To find good deals refer to Brickseat.com, and for pick up dates, just google the name of the 
            town and bulk pick up (ex. Colts Neck bulk pick up).</p>
