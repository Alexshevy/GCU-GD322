    <H1>Pick and Flip </H1>
  <p>When springtime comes around everyone seems to be doing spring cleaning. 
  Many townships have bulk/garbage pick-up days, in which everyone puts their used furniture, 
  toys, tools, and anything imaginable on the curb. This is when you drive through the 
  neighborhoods and pick up anything that is valuable to resell. Remember to keep in mind that 
  since you are making a 100% profit it could be sold for less than its actual value. For example, 
  let say there is a wooden rocking chair in good condition, and a similar new one would cost $100. 
  I could then sell the used wooden rocking chair for $75 on the Facebook Marketplace and make a 100% 
  profit. In addition, items picked up from the curb could be refurbished (painted and cleaned) to 
  increase its value.</p>
  
  
  <H1>How To Pick and Flip </H1>
  
  <p>Step 1: Look up the bulk/garbage pick-up dates and times for the towns in your local county or 
  surrounding counties. Keep in mind this is usually seasonal and lasts from spring to early summer.</p>
  
  <p>Step 2: Once the dates and times are known, print out a map of the town, and highlight the 
  neighborhood you want to check out.</p>
  
  <p>Step 3: Begin to drive around and pick up any items which seem to be in resalable condition</p>
  
  <p>Step 4: Clean up items and take good pictures.</p>
  
  <p>Step 5: Post them on the Facebook Marketplace and wait for responses</p>
