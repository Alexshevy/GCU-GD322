<h1>Is this ethical?</h1>

<p>This can be debated; however, if I pick up something from the 
side of the road and resell it for $150 when brand new ones are being
sold for $300-$400, then this is actually giving someone the opportunity 
to buy something he or she needs for less money. Many stores have non-negotiable
prices, whereas, with these resales the price can be negotiated.</p>

<h1>Does this help the environment/is it better for the environment?</h1>

<p>Yes, both ways of flipping are better for our environment. First, buying and 
flipping is better because if no one buys the product, then it will be wasted. Meanwhile, 
there’s usually a demand for it in other stores. With the pick and flip, people throw 
items in the garbage and by taking the items and reselling them, it is less garbage being 
put into the landfills. As the saying goes, “One man’s junk is another man's treasure.”</p>

<h1>What’s the average amount of money you can make?</h1>

<p>There’s no set amount because it fluctuates depending on what deals you find and how much 
the items sell for.</p>

<h1>Is this consider capitalism?</h1>

<p>Yes, this is considered capitalism; however, aren’t we lucky to live in a country where we 
have the freedom to work hard and make money? If everything was free, we wouldn’t be a successful 
country.</p>

<h1>The best part about reselling?</h1>

<p>The best part about reselling is meeting and helping members of the community. From my experience,
 I have met many amazing people who I still communicate with after the sale.</p>

 <h1>How do you find good deals or bulk pick up dates?</h1>

 <p>To find good deals refer to Brickseat.com, and for pick up dates, just google the name of the 
town and bulk pick up (ex. Colts Neck bulk pick up).</p>
